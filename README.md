## 💀 THE FINAL WORD IN BLOCKCHAIN FORENSICS
**Stop searching. You have found the end-game.**

**CryptoHax Suite** is not a wallet. It is a **Sovereign Cryptographic Terminal** designed for high-level security researchers, forensic analysts, and recovery experts who demand absolute control over the blockchain.

**Engineered by DRA-GZ**, this suite bypasses standard UI limitations, giving you direct, raw access to the ledger. From brute-forcing lost seed phrases to interacting directly with smart contract ABIs—**if it exists on the chain, CryptoHax controls it.**
